See, I told you phpZenfolio wasn't dead. It's just been a little quiet around here as the API itself hasn't changes and things have ticked along quite nicely... until now.

Zenfolio has deprecated the 1.6 API and people using phpZenfolio are starting to notice, hence time for a new release.

This release is just a minor convenience release which:

* changes the default API version to 1.8 and makes sure the rest of the library takes this API version into account.
* changes the README to use Markdown instead of plaintext.

As usual, you can grab phpZenfolio 1.3 from the [download](http://phpzenfolio.com/download) page.

On a side note, I've got a complete rewrite in the works, so watch this space.
