Well, finally the day has come for me to put the phpZenfolio source code onto a public repository.

I've just spent the morning converting my internal Mercurial repo to a Git repo and uploading to [GitHub](http://github.com). In the coming days I'll manually transfer all the bugs logged to GitHub and then the Current Issues page will pull in the bugs from the [issues on GitHub](https://github.com/lildude/phpZenfolio/issues).

So with [phpZenfolio out on GitHub](https://github.com/lildude/phpZenfolio), please feel free to log issues on GitHub or fork the code and submit your changes via pull requests.
