And just when you thought phpZenfolio was dead, I go an release a new version.

Thankfully Zenfolio seems to be keeping their API quite stable so very few changes are required in phpZenfolio.  That said, I have made this point release just to provide you with the following changes:

* Changed API endpoint to use api.zenfolio.com as requested by Zenfolio
* Changed default API version to 1.6
* Added ability to perform ALL API requests over HTTPS ([Ticket 4](https://github.com/lildude/phpZenfolio/issues/4))

phpZenfolio 1.2 is now available on the [download](http://phpzenfolio.com/download) page.
