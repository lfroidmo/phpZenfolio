<div class="intro">Welcome to phpZenfolio</div>
<p>phpZenfolio is a PHP wrapper class for the Zenfolio API written and maintained by Colin Seymour. The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the Zenfolio API in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.</p>
