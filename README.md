A simple object orientated wrapper for the Zenfolio API, written in PHP.

The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers quick and easy interaction with the Zenfolio API, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

**Note: phpZenfolio 2.0.0 and later is not backwardly compatible with earlier releases.**

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.6.0,
* [Guzzle 6](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) library,
* (optional) [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) and [php-cs-fixer](http://cs.sensiolabs.org/) to run tests.

## Installation

The recommended method of installing phpZenfolio is using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org). If you have Composer installed, you can install phpZenfolio and all its dependencies from within your project directory:

```bash
$ composer require lildude/phpzenfolio
```

Alternatively, you can add the following to your project's `composer.json`:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "lildude/phpzenfolio": "^2.0"
    }
}
```

.. and then run `composer update` from within your project directory.

If you don't have Composer installed, you can download it using:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

## Basic Usage of the phpZenfolio Client

`phpZenfolio` follows the PSR-1, PSR-2 and PSR-4 conventions, which means you can easily use Composer's [autoloading](https://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md#autoloading) to integrate `phpZenfolio` into your projects.

```php
<?php
// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new phpZenfolio\Client('My Cool App/1.0 (http://app.com)'));
$photoset = $client->LoadPhotoSet(12345, 'Level1');
```

From the `$client` object, you have access to all the [Zenfolio API methods](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/help/api/ref/methods).

* [`example-login.php`](examples/example-login.php) illustrates how to login and display the images in your first photoset or collection.
* [`example-user.php`](examples/example-user.php) illustrates how to display the first 96 public photos of the specified user's first public photoset found.
