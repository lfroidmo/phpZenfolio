{{ site.name }} is a PHP wrapper class for the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx). The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx) in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

# Using {{ site.name }}

# Contributing

If you would like to contribute to the development of {{ site.name }} by offering enhancements or bug fixes, please feel free.  I'm a big fan of GitHub's ["Fork & Pull" development methodology](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) so...

1. Fork the [{{ site.name }} repository](https://github.com/lildude/{{ site.name }}) on GitHub.
2. If you're submitting a fix or improvement to the phpSmug code or submitting a new example, create a new branch from the `master` branch, for example: `your-fork/some-cool-feature` or `your-fork/fixing-something-broken` branch.
3. If you're submitting a fix or improvement to the phpSmug website or documentation, create a new branch from the `gh-pages` branch.
4. If you're submitting code changes, as opposed to documentation, write tests that fail without your changes and pass with them.
5. Ensure all tests pass locally by running: `vendor/bin/phpunit` within your local clone of the repository.
6. Submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

All pull requests will be reviewed and will be merged once all tests have passed.
