{{ site.name }} is a PHP wrapper class for the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx). The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx) in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.
