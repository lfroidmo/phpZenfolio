{{ site.name }} is a PHP wrapper class for the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx). The intention of this class is to allow PHP application developers to quickly and easily interact with the [Zenfolio API](http://www.zenfolio.com/zf/tools/api.aspx) in their applications, without having to worry about the finer details of the API.

{{ site.name }} is based closely on the work I have done with [phpSmug](http://phpsmug.com).

Not already a [Zenfolio](http://www.zenfolio.com) user?  Here, have a $5 discount off your first year on me by [registering](https://www.zenfolio.com/zf/signup/registration.aspx) using this code:
